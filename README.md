# todo-list

This application is generated using [LoopBack 4 CLI](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Command-line-interface.html) with the
[initial project layout](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Loopback-application-layout.html).

### Simple Todo model created using Loopback4.

Wanted a little experience using it to scaffold node.js/express Crud functionality. 
A little bit of a learning curve compared to just using Node/Express, but familiarity with Graphql
and TypeScript has made it easier to follow.
